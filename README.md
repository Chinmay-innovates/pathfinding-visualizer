## Introduction
This project is designed to help users visualize how different pathfinding algorithms operate. By allowing you to place start and end points, draw walls, and observe the algorithm's step-by-step process, you can gain a deeper understanding of how these algorithms navigate through obstacles to find the shortest path.

## Features
- **Interactive Grid**: Create and modify grids by adding walls, weights, and setting start/end points.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from a variety of pathfinding algorithms to visualize.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch the algorithm explore the grid in real-time.
- **Customizable Speed**: Adjust the visualization speed to better understand the algorithm's process.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on different screen sizes.

## Algorithms Included
The following algorithms are currently implemented:
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **A\* Search Algorithm**
- **J\* Search Algorithm**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Greedy Best-First Search**
- **Bidirectional BFS**
- **Bidirectional A\***

  ## Mazes Included
- Binary Tree Algorithm
- Recursive Division Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Wilson's Algorithm
  
## How to Use
1. **Set Start and End Points**: Click on the grid to place the start (green) and end (red) points.
2. **Draw Walls**: Click and drag to add walls (black) that act as obstacles.
3. **Choose an Algorithm**: Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
4. **Visualize**: Click the "Visualize" button to see the algorithm in action.
5. **Adjust Speed**: Use the speed slider to control the visualization speed.
6. **Reset**: Clear the grid or reset the visualization at any time.
